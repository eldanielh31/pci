    Simics now only embeds
    a Python 3 interpreter. </li><li> The separation of source code into separate
    packages has been
    removed. Source code is now included directly into
    each package. </li><li> The installers for Linux and macOS have
    been updated.
    Support for fallback mode of decryption keys has
    been removed. </li></ul></li><li><b>Python</b><ul><li>The Simics embedded Python interpreter
    has been upgraded to version 3.10.13.</li><li>The Simics embedded Python interpreter
    has been upgraded to version 3.10.12.</li><li>The Simics embedded Python interpreter
    has been upgraded to version 3.9.18.</li><li>The Python library <code>lxml</code>
      has been removed from the Simics Base package, for security
      reasons (bug #SIMICS-20978).</li><li> Simics now distributes
  <code>pyi</code> files of the core Python modules.</li><li> Simics no longer distributes
  pypredef files of the core Python modules.</li><li>The Simics embedded Python interpreter
    has been upgraded to version 3.9.16.</li><li>The Simics embedded Python interpreter
    has been upgraded to version 3.9.15.</li><li>The Python library now
  includes <code>pip</code> and <code>setuptools</code>, so that <code>pip</code>
  can be used with <code>mini-python</code>
  (bug #HSD-14018026828).</li><li>Python deprecation warnings are now
  turned on, unless Simics is started
  with <code>-wno-deprecated</code>. If Simics is started
  with <code>-werror</code> then the deprecation warnings result in Python
  exceptions (bug #SIMICS-20274).</li><li>Python warning filters can now be
  controlled using the <code>SIMICS_PYTHONWARNINGS</code> environment
  variable. The supported usage is the simple all warning
  unconditional override described
  at <a class="jdocu" href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONWARNINGS" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_top">https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONWARNINGS</a>.</li><li>Fixed a problem in the Tcl/Tk
  library included with Python on Windows.</li><li>Python upgraded to Python 3.9 due
  to Python 3.7 is going EOL mid-2023. Required changes to user
  Python code may include not distributing <code>.pyc</code> files and updates to
  valid Python 3.9 code.</li><li>On Windows, the Simics embedded
    Python interpreter has been upgraded to version 3.7.13. The
    linked <code>zlib</code> library has been upgraded to
    1.2.13.</li><li>The Python library now
  includes the <code>psutil</code> module.</li><li>The Python library now
  includes the <code>ipyxact</code> module.</li><li>The Python library now
  includes the sqlite3 module (bug #HSD-14017070185).</li><li>The Python library on Windows now
  includes the Tcl/Tk library, so that the <code>tkinter</code> module can be
  used.</li><li>The Simics embedded Python interpreter
    has been upgraded to version 3.7.12.</li><li>The Simics embedded Python interpreter
    has been upgraded to version 3.7.11.</li><li>The Simics embedded Python interpreter
    has been upgraded to version 3.7.9.</li><li> Removed <code>numpy</code> from the Simics
    Python distribution. </li><li> The Simics embedded Python 2 interpreter
    has been upgraded to
    version 2.7.16, on Windows. </li><li> The Simics embedded Python 3 interpreter
    has been upgraded to
    version 3.7.4, on Windows. </li><li> The numpy package that is distributed with
    the Simics Python 3
    interpreter has been upgraded to version 1.17, on Windows
    (bug #HSD-2208178272). </li><li> Fixed a problem where the wrong OpenSSL was
    used by the Simics
    Python 2 interpreter on Linux

    has been upgraded to
    version 2.7.16, on Linux and macOS. </li><li> The Simics embedded Python 3 interpreter
    has been upgraded to
    version 3.7.4, on Linux and macOS. </li><li> Simics now supports Python 3.7.2 as its
    builtin Python
    interpreter. The default is still Python 2.7 and this will be
    supported until its EOL, which is 1st of
    January 2020. </li></ul></li><li><b>mini-python</b><ul><li> On Windows,
      the <code>mini-python</code> binary now respects long paths if
      enabled on the system; in particular, if the registry key
      <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem\LongPathsEnabled</code>
      is set to 1, then the binary can run a Python file whose path
      exceeds 260 characters
      (bug #HSD-22018805048). </li><li> On Linux, the <code>mini-python</code> binary
    can now be used with the <code>venv</code> and <code>pip</code> Python
    modules to install extra libraries
    (bug #HSD-18023192821). </li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>

This section briefly describes the known limitations of the
Simics Python package. Please refer to section
<a class="reference" href="#Detailed-List-of-Limitations">5</a> for a more technical
description.

For model oriented packages, additional limitations may be found in
the model target guides.

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Detailed-List-of-Limitations">5 Detailed List of Limitations</a></h2>
<p>

This section describes in detail the known limitations of the
Simics Python package. Please refer to
section <a class="reference" href="#Limitations">4</a> for a more general description.
</p><p>
A register or field marked as <i>Not implemented</i> is present with
read-write semantics but has no side effects on simulation. A register
marked as <i>Not implemented (design limitation)</i> has the same
semantics as a "Not implemented" register and there is no
plan to extend the model with this functionality. A register with
<i>Lack of documentation</i> has not been implemented because there is
no available documentation describing its semantics.
